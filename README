Perl 6 in Perl 5

After building Parrot and Rakudo I set the RAKUDO_DIR 
environment variable to point to the directory 
where Rakudo was checked out. I also set the PARROT_DIR 
environment variable to point to the directory 
where Parrot was checked out (in the currently standard setup
that would be $RAKUDO_DIR/parrot).

Then I had to build Parrot::Embed
cd $PARROT_DIR/ext/Parrot-Embed
perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test

Then I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to $PARROT_DIR/blib/lib/

This is what I have now in .bashrc

   export RAKUDO_DIR=$HOME/work/rakudo
   export PARROT_DIR=$RAKUDO_DIR/parrot
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PARROT_DIR/blib/lib/


Other than that

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
